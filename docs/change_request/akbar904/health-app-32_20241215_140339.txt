Write me an app that has a student course management system with these features:


A page to view all enrolled courses in a card layout
Each course card should show the course name, schedule, professor, and credits
A form to add new courses with fields for course details
Ability to remove courses from the schedule
Use modern UI components and a responsive design
Please include sample data to demonstrate the functionality
